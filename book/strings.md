## Strings

  - [6.1](#6.1) <a name='6.1'></a> Use single quotes `''` for strings. eslint: [`quotes`](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/quotes.html) jscs: [`validateQuoteMarks`](http://jscs.info/rule/validateQuoteMarks)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const name = "Capt. Janeway";

    // good
    const name = 'Capt. Janeway';
    ```

  - [6.2](#6.2) <a name='6.2'></a> Strings that cause the line to go over 100 characters should be written across multiple lines using string concatenation.
  - [6.3](#6.3) <a name='6.3'></a> Note: If overused, long strings with concatenation could impact performance. [jsPerf](http://jsperf.com/ya-string-concat) & [Discussion](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/40).

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do with this, you would get nowhere fast.';

    // bad
    const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because \
    of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do \
    with this, you would get nowhere \
    fast.';

    // good
    const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because ' +
      'of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do ' +
      'with this, you would get nowhere fast.';
    ```

  <a name="es6-template-literals"></a>
  - [6.4](#6.4) <a name='6.4'></a> When programmatically building up strings, use template strings instead of concatenation. eslint: [`prefer-template`](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-template.html) [`template-curly-spacing`](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/template-curly-spacing) jscs: [`requireTemplateStrings`](http://jscs.info/rule/requireTemplateStrings)

    > Why? Template strings give you a readable, concise syntax with proper newlines and string interpolation features.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return 'How are you, ' + name + '?';
    }

    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return ['How are you, ', name, '?'].join();
    }

    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return `How are you, ${ name }?`;
    }

    // good
    function sayHi(name) {
      return `How are you, ${name}?`;
    }
    ```
  - [6.5](#6.5) <a name='6.5'></a> Never use `eval()` on a string, it opens too many vulnerabilities.
