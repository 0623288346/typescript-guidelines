# Introduction

I created this TypeScript guideline as I learn about the ins and outs of TypeScript. It started as a style guide but I quickly realize I can't just talk about style choices without the arguments supporting them.

Before I dive into the guideline, I would like to describe a little bit about myself and my style of writing, in light of helping you to understand why I write and describe certain things in certain ways, so that you can better digest the material and ideas present in it.

As you can probably guess, I'm an engineer. I'm also the creator of the Timely Wealth methodology, which is an life achievement system based on time management and wealth accumulation. I'm also a business owner which makes me pretty familiar with (and influenced by) legal writings. Also, I'm born in Hong Kong so English is my second language.

Because of my background, I'm pretty meticulous on the terms I use to describe things and also extremely meticulous on what I share with my audience (in this case, it would be you who is reading this guideline and also you who will be writing code in TypeScript).

Sometimes I'll go pretty deep on a particular topic, and it would be too deep for you if it is the first time you study on the particular topic. If you encounter such case, my best advise is to check the FAQ section at the end of each topic (if exists), and if you can't find the answer you are looking for, create an issue at the [github repository](https://github.com/unional/typescript/issues). I would find time to answer your questions and add them to the FAQ for the benefit of other people. In the mean time (before I get a chance to answer your questions, which might take a while due to my packed schedule), you can move on to other topics and re-visit that topic in the future. As you gain more experience, my hope is the materials and ideas would make more sense to you down the road.

Of course, sometime I would make mistakes (in fact, many times). I may not use the right term due to my limited English, or I made the wrong conclusion, or TypeScript has evolved and my idea does not apply anymore. In these cases, also feel free in opening issues at the [github repository](https://github.com/unional/typescript/issues). I would love to learn, grow, and update this guideline along the way.

I wish you would enjoy this guideline as well as learning something from it.

Best,
Homa Wong (unional)
