# Handbook vs Guideline

This guideline serves as a complement to the [official handbook](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html).
In the handbook, it talks about *what is TypeScript*.
In this guideline, I talk about *how to write TypeScript*.

## Design Principles

- Get the best out of TypeScript
- Stay close to JavaScript as much as possible
- Embrace latest JavaScript syntax
- Cross-compatible with tools. It's frustrating when your tools do not get along with each other!
  - IDE / Editors
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
    - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
