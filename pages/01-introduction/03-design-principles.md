# Handbook vs Guideline

This guideline serves as a complement to the [official handbook](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html).
In the handbook, it focus on *what is TypeScript*.
In this guideline, I focus on *how to write TypeScript* and *how to get the most out of TyepScript*.

## Design Principles

- Get the best out of TypeScript
- Stay close to JavaScript as much as possible
- Embrace latest JavaScript syntax
- Cross-compatible with tools. It's frustrating when your tools do not get along with each other!
  - IDE / Editors
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
    - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
  - Linter
    - [tslint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint)

### How the Book is Organized

I vision this is a reference book instead of a book that you would read from start to end.
My goal in designing the chapters and pages of this book is that when you have a specific question in mind, you can skim through the table of content and knows right away where to look for answers.

If it fails to do so, open an [issue](https://github.com/unional/typescript/issues) :)
