# Typescript Style Guide

A mostly reasonable approach to TypeScript. Based off of [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with some of [my touch](https://github.com/unional/javascript).

## Design Directions
* Get the best out of TypeScript
* Remain close to JavaScript as much as possible
* Embrace latest JavaScript syntax
