# File and Folder Structures


## File line endings
- Keep line ending in `LF` if your team work on both windows and *nix.

> Why? `CRLF` would cause grief on *nix system (double blank lines)


## File EOF (End of line)
- Except docs such as `.md`, all files should end with a newline.

```ts
// bad <<EOF

// good
<<EOF
```
